\section{HelloWorld for Java}

\subsection{Scope}

In this tutorial you will build your first very simple \eTrice{} model. The goal is to learn the work flow of 
\eTrice{} and to understand a few basic features of ROOM. You will perform the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item create a new model from scratch
\item add a very simple state machine to an actor
\item generate the source code
\item run the model
\item open the message sequence chart
\end{enumerate}

Make sure that you have set up the workspace as described in \emph{Setting up the Workspace for Java}.

\subsection{Create a new model from scratch}

The easiest way to create a new \eTrice{} Project is to use the eclipse project wizard. From the eclipse file 
menu select \emph{File->New->Project} and create a new \emph{Empty eTrice Java Project} and name it \textbf{HelloWorld}.

The wizard creates everything that is needed to create, build and run an \eTrice{} model. The resulting 
project should look like this:

% !images/015-HelloWorld11.png!

Within the model directory the model file \emph{HelloWorld.room} was created. Open the 
\emph{HelloWorld.room} file and delete the contents of the file. Open the content assist with Ctrl+Space 
and select \emph{RoomModel - model skeleton}.

Edit the template variables by typing the new names and jumping with Tab from name to name.

The resulting model code should look like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=ROOM]
RoomModel HelloWorld_Model {

	LogicalSystem LogSys1 {
		SubSystemRef subSysRef1: SubSysClass1
	}

	SubSystemClass SubSysClass1 {
		ActorRef actorRef1: HelloWorldTop
		LogicalThread defaultThread
	}

	ActorClass HelloWorldTop { }

}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Build and run the model}

Now the model is finished and the source code can be generated. The project wizard has created a launch 
configuration that is responsible for generating the source code. In the project \textit{HelloWorld} right click \emph{\_HelloWorld.launch} and run it as \emph{gen\_HelloWorld}.

The source code for the model will be generated into the folder \emph{src-gen}. The main function will be contained in \emph{SubSystem\_HelloWorldRunner.java}. Select this file and run it as Java application.

The Hello World application starts and the string \emph{"Hello World"} will be printed into the console window. To stop the application the user must type \emph{quit} in the console window.

\subsection{Summary}

Now you have generated your first \eTrice{} model from scratch. You can switch between diagram editor and 
textual model representation (.room file) and you can see what will be generated during editing and saving the diagram files. 
You should take a look at the generated source files to understand how the state machine is generated and 
the life cycle of the application works. The next tutorials will deal with more complex hierarchies in structure and behavior.
