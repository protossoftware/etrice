    ## Headers

    ```no-highlight
    # H1
    ## H2
    ### H3
    #### H4
    ##### H5
    ###### H6

    Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

    Alt-H2

    ```

    ## Emphasis

    ```no-highlight
    Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

    Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

    Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

    Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

    &lt;a name=&quot;lists&quot;/&gt;
    ## Lists

    (In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: ⋅)

    ```no-highlight
    1. First ordered list item
    2. Another item
      * Unordered sub-list. 
    1. Actual numbers don&#39;t matter, just that it&#39;s a number
      1. Ordered sub-list
    4. And another item.

       You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we&#39;ll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

       To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
       Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
       (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

    * Unordered list can use asterisks
    - Or minuses
    + Or pluses
    ```

    &lt;a name=&quot;links&quot;/&gt;
    ## Links

    There are two ways to create links.

    ```no-highlight
    [I&#39;m an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

    [I&#39;m an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com &quot;Google&#39;s Homepage&quot;)

    [I&#39;m a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

    [I&#39;m a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

    [You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

    Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

    Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

    [arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
    [1]: http://slashdot.org
    [link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
    ```

    &lt;a name=&quot;code&quot;/&gt;
    ## Code and Syntax Highlighting

    Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn&#39;t. However, many renderers -- like Github&#39;s and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).

    ```no-highlight
    Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
    ```

    Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

    Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks &lt;code&gt;```&lt;/code&gt;, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they&#39;re easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

    &lt;pre lang=&quot;no-highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;```javascript
    var s = &quot;JavaScript syntax highlighting&quot;;
    alert(s);
    ```

    ```python
    s = &quot;Python syntax highlighting&quot;
    print s
    ```

    ```
    No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
    But let&#39;s throw in a &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;tag&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;.
    ```
    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



    ```javascript
    var s = &quot;JavaScript syntax highlighting&quot;;
    alert(s);
    ```

    ```python
    s = &quot;Python syntax highlighting&quot;
    print s
    ```

    ```
    No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github). 
    But let&#39;s throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.
    ```


    &lt;a name=&quot;tables&quot;/&gt;
    ## Tables

    Tables aren&#39;t part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and *Markdown Here* supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

    ```no-highlight
    Colons can be used to align columns.

    | Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
    | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
    | col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
    | col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
    | zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

    The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don&#39;t need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

    Markdown | Less | Pretty
    --- | --- | ---
    *Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
    1 | 2 | 3
    ```

    &lt;a name=&quot;blockquotes&quot;/&gt;
    ## Blockquotes

    ```no-highlight
    &gt; Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
    &gt; This line is part of the same quote.

    Quote break.

    &gt; This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let&#39;s keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 
    ```

    &lt;a name=&quot;html&quot;/&gt;
    ## Inline HTML

    You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it&#39;ll mostly work pretty well. 

    ```no-highlight
    &lt;dl&gt;
      &lt;dt&gt;Definition list&lt;/dt&gt;
      &lt;dd&gt;Is something people use sometimes.&lt;/dd&gt;

      &lt;dt&gt;Markdown in HTML&lt;/dt&gt;
      &lt;dd&gt;Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML &lt;em&gt;tags&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;/dl&gt;
    ```

    &lt;dl&gt;
      &lt;dt&gt;Definition list&lt;/dt&gt;
      &lt;dd&gt;Is something people use sometimes.&lt;/dd&gt;

      &lt;dt&gt;Markdown in HTML&lt;/dt&gt;
      &lt;dd&gt;Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML &lt;em&gt;tags&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;/dl&gt;

    &lt;a name=&quot;hr&quot;/&gt;
    ## Horizontal Rule

    ```
    Three or more...

    ---

    Hyphens

    ***

    Asterisks

    ___

    Underscores
    ```

    ## Line Breaks

    My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit &amp;lt;Enter&amp;gt; once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You&#39;ll soon learn to get what you want. &quot;Markdown Toggle&quot; is your friend. 

    Here are some things to try out:

    ```
    Here&#39;s a line for us to start with.

    This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

    This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
    This line is only separated by a single newline, so it&#39;s a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
    ```

    This line is also begins a separate paragraph, but...  
    This line is only separated by a single newline, so it&#39;s a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

    (Technical note: *Markdown Here* uses GFM line breaks, so there&#39;s no need to use MD&#39;s two-space line breaks.)

    &lt;a name=&quot;videos&quot;/&gt;
    ## Youtube videos

    They can&#39;t be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

    ```no-highlight
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
    &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg&quot; 
    alt=&quot;IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; border=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    ```

    Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

    ```no-highlight
    [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
    ```

    Referencing a bug by #bugID in your git commit links it to the slip. For example #1.
