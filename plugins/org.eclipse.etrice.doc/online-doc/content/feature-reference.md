# ROOMLanguage
The Real Time Object Oriented Modeling (ROOM)

eTrice comprises several models:

- the ROOM model (*.room) -- defines model classes and the logical structure of the model
- the Config model (*.config) -- defines configuration values for attributes
- the Physical model (*.etphys) -- defines the structure and properties of the physical system
- the Mapping model (*.etmap) -- defines a mapping from logical elements to physical elements


In the following diagram the models and their relations are depicted. The meaning of the arrows is: uses/references.

## ConfigModel
The ConfigModel describes the Attribute configuration of ActorInstances and PortInstances. 

The scope of this model is the configuration of Attributes of the LogicalModel.
Thus it provides enhanced capabilities for assigning default values to Attributes, which are:

- type safe value assignment
- setting on class level
- setting on instance level

Values defined for class attributes are used for all instances unless there is an instance value configured for the same attribute.
The configuration is available for actors and ports, thus ActorClasses/ActorRefs and ProtocolClasses/Ports.

```etconfig
ConfigModel ExampleConfig {
	import Example.* from "Example.room"

	ActorClassConfig ActorClass1 {
		Attr attribute1 = 4
	}

	ActorInstanceConfig LogSys/subsysRef/actor1 {
		Attr attribute1 = 7
	}
}
```

## LogicalModel
The LogicalModel describes the logical structure and behavior of a ROOM application

The ROOM model defines DataTypes, ProtocolClasses, ActorClasses, SubSystemClasses and LogicalSystems.
Thereby the three latter form a hierarchy. The LogicalSystem is the top level element of the structure. 
It contains references to SubSystemClass elements. The SubSystemClass in turn contains 
references to ActorClass elements which again contain (recursively) references to 
ActorClass elements. The complete structural hierarchy implies a tree which has the 
LogicalSystem as root and where each reference stands for a new node with possibly further 
branches.

### ActorClass
An actor is the basic structural building block for building systems with ROOM

An ActorClass consists of three main parts:

- **Interface** (external interface) specifies the communication to 'outside' actors and consists of Ports.
- **Structure** (internal interface) contains Ports, Attributes and ActorRefs. These elements are accessible from the Behavior part of the actor (in contrary to the external interface above). An ActorClass can be composed of other actors again by declaring ActorRefs. Also this part declares the connection of ports in form of Bindings and LayerConnections.
- **Behavior** is described by the StateMachine. It can receive and send messages from the ports, declared in the Structure above. The Attributes can be used to store data during an state transition. Furthermore it is possible to declare Operations. They can be used to define reusable logic, that is invoked during a state transition.


![ActorClass](images/040-ActorClass.png)

```room
 ActorClass ExampleActorClass {
	 Interface {
		 Port port1: ProtocolClass1
		 Port port4: ProtocolClass1
	 }
	 Structure {
		 external Port port1
		 conjugated Port port2: ProtocolClass1
		 conjugated Port port3: ProtocolClass1
		 
		 ActorRef ActorRef_A: ActorClass2
		 ActorRef ActorRef_B: ActorClass3
		 
		 Binding port2 and ActorRef_A.port5
		 // ...
	 }
	 Behavior {
		 // ...
	 }
 }
```

### ActorRef
An ActorRef is an instance of an ActorClass

- ActorClass: The type of the ActorRef
- Multiplicity: The number of instances. A number greater than one can be seen as an array of instances
- Reference Type: Can be fixed or optional. Fixed requires an integer multiplicity and results in an static instantiation with an fixed number of instances during runtime . Optional denotes an dynamic instantiation, where ActorRefs can be created in arbitrary number during runtime. In this case, the multiplicity has to be set to '*'

### Annotation
An Annotation can be attached to a ROOM classes to apply the properties of its AnnotationType

It refers to an AnnotationType and may have to pass key value pairs. Its notation is similar to Java:

```room
@AnnotationType1
@AnnotationType2(key1="STRING", key2=3, ...)
```

See section Annotations for further reading.

### AnnotationType
AnnotationTypes can be used to tag ROOM classes for further custom processing

They provide the ability to associate custom properties to ROOM classes, that adjust or toogle features, like generation or the runtime behavior.
eTrice has some built-in annotations, which can be found in Annotations.room within the eTrice modellib.

See section Annotations for further reading.

### Attribute
An Attribute is a member variable of a class

An Attribute can be be used to store arbitrary data. There are two common conceptual purpose of use:


- model current system state (state machine variable)
- store reference to more fine-grained components (e.g. c pointer to handle)

Attributes can be defined in several ROOM classes.

		Attribute refAttribue : voidType ref = "NULL" // set reference in constructor or in state machine
	}
}
```

### Binding
A Binding connects two Ports with each other

In essence, a binding is a abstraction for an underlying communication channel whose function is to convey messages from one port to the other.
The precise semantics of these channels are not defined in the Binding. Instead, they are determined by the ProtocolClasses that are associated with the Ports at the end of the Binding.

```room
ActorClass ExampleActorClass {
	Structure {
		conjugated Port sender: ProtocolClass1
		ActorRef actorRef: ActorClass2
		
		Binding sender and actorRef.receiver
	}
}
```

### CommunicationType
The CommunicationType defines the communication semantics of a ProtocolClass

Since from ROOM models executable code can be generated, it is important to define the way the actors are executed and communicate with each other.
The combination of communication and execution is called the *execution model*. Therefore the ExecutionType of an actor and the CommunicationType of the ports has to be considered.

The CommunicationType of a ProtocolClass (and thus of a Port) specifies in which way the communication should happen:

- **message driven** -- asynchronous, non blocking, no return value: Usually the message driven communication is implemented with message queues. Message queues are inherently asynchronous and enable a very good decoupling of the communicating parties.
- **data driven** -- asynchronous, non blocking, no return value: In data driven communication sender and receiver often have a shared block of data. The sender writes the data and the receiver polls the data.
- _**function call** -- synchronous, blocking, return value: Regular function call as known in most programming languages._ (not supported yet)

CommunicationType relates with the [ExecutionType][] of an ActorClass, e.g. a data-driven port needs a cyclic thread, that polls the shared data.

	}
}

datadriven ProtocolClass DatadrivenProtocolClass {
	incoming {

	}
	// datadriven ProtocolClass can only have incoming messages (signals)
}

//  sync is not supported yet
//	sync ProtocolClass SyncProtcolClass { 
//		
//	}
```

### DataClass
A DataClass is a composition of Attributes

Intended to model a type that primarily consists of data, which is usually grouped together in some manner. DataClasses roughly translate to Java classes without interaction or C <em>struct</em>s.

```room
DataClass TCPConnectionData {
	Attribute IPAddr: string
	Attribute TcpPort: int32
}
```

### ExecutionType
Determines the execution type of an actor

Since from ROOM models executable code can be generated, it is important to define the way the actors are 
executed and communicate with each other. The combination of communication and execution is called the 
*execution model*. Therefore the ExecutionType of an actor and the CommunicationType of the ports has to be considered.

The ExecutionType of an ActorClass specifies in which way its instance (ActorRef) should be executed:

- **execution by receive event**: The message queue or the event dispatcher calls a **receive event** function of the message receiver and thereby executes the processing of the event.
- **polled execution**: The objects are processed by a cyclic **execute** call
- _**execution by function call**: The caller executes the called object via function call_ (not supported yet)
- **mixture**: An asynchronous execution combines an event dispatcher and a polled execution.


Thereby the ExecutionType determines the execution mode of the actor's logical thread:

The actual execution of the underlying physical thread can be specified in the PhysicalModel in conjunction with the MappingModel.

ExecutionType relates to the [CommunicationType][], e.g. if an actor uses data-driven ports, it should support an polled execution.

### ExternalEndPort
A ExternalEndPort is an interface Port, that is made accessible to the internal interface of an ActorClass

```room
ActorClass ExternalEndPortExample {

			// external calls or casts may need includes
			write(someHandle, param1);

	}
}
```

### Inheritance
A class can specify a super class and inherits elements from the super class hierarchy

When a ROOM class specifies a super class, it generally inherits all elements and properties.
In several cases, it is possible, to override these inherited elements. Generally, eTrice has two semantics of overriding: refinement and replacement.
Refinement is used in most cases (e.g. StateMachine) and realizes an extension of the overridden elements.
In this case, if a sub class overrides a piece of logic from a super class, it will always be executed subsequently to the inherited.
Contrary to this, replacement is applied to overridden Operations, similar to programming languages C++ and Java.

A formal definition of overriding is given below:

- early or late resolve - if element is overridden, which one should super class use by default - own or override ?
- replacing or refinement - ignore inherited code or prepend inherited code automatically ?
- (non-)accessible - if element is overridden, is super class' original accessible from sub class ? e.g. super.foo()
- implicit or explicit - does it use distinct model element / keyword?


Examples programming languages:
c++ virtual function and java override  <==> accessible explicit late replacing
c++ function redefine <==> accessible implicit early replacing
c++ dtor <==> late refinement\\

eTrice override of model elements:
Operations (C generation)  <==> non\_accessible explicit late replacing
Operations (Java generation) <==> accessible explicit late replacing
State and Transitions <==> non-accessible explicit late refinement
ctor/dtor <==> non\_accessible implicit late refinement
StateMachine <==> non-accessible implicit late refinement
UserCode <==> non-accessible implicit late refinement

### LayerConnection
A LayerConnection associates a SPP to an ActorRef, resulting in an connection of all SAPs on its instance hierarchy


- An actor class can define a Service Provision Point (SPP) to publish a specific service, defined by a protocol class
- An actor class can define a Service Access Point (SAP) if it needs a service, defined by a protocol class
- For a given actor hierarchy, a LayerConnection defines which SAP will be satisfied by (connected to) which SPP

### LogicalSystem
The LogicalSystem is the topmost structural class. It assembles a distributed system by means of sub systems

It describes the logical topology of your distributed system and is composed of sub systems (SubSystemRefs). Thus it is the notationally root of every instance path or actor hierarchy.

### Operation
An Operation is a member function of a class

Operations can be used to define a piece of reusable logic. The definition consists of:

- Arbitrary amount of arguments
- Return type
- User code body, which can access the structural part of the containing class (e.g. attributes)
- 'override' keyword, replaces the logic of the inherited operation having the same signature

	}
}
```

### Port
A Port is an instance of a ProtocolClass and the interface for an ActorClass

Once a ProtocolClass has been created, it can be used to define actor interfaces. This is accomplished by means of Ports. 
A Port is a declaration that the set of messages defined by its ProtocolClass is now part of the actor's interface.
It provides strong decoupling of ActorClasses from each other, thus enabling easy testability, reusability and deployment of actors to different threads or nodes.

```room
ActorClass Example {
	Structure{
		Port port0 : ProtocolClass1
	}
	Behavior {
		// send/receive message from port0
	}
}
```

For communication between two actors to take place, a connection must be established between a port on one of the actors and a port on the other.
One condition is, that both Ports have compatible ProtocolClasses. In most cases the Ports simply refer to the same protocol.
In addition, a ProtocolClass has an imposed directionality - it defines one subset of messages as incoming and the complementary subset as outgoing.
Which subset is labeled as incoming and outgoing is arbitrary, it simply depends on the point of view, that was taken when defining.
Therefore Ports can be 'regular' and 'conjugated'. When two actors communicate by a connected pair of Ports, one Port has to be regular and the other conjugated.
The ProtocolClass' incoming messages are on one side received by the regular Port and on the other sent by the conjugated Port (outgoing message vice versa).

A connection of Ports is denoted by a Binding.

### ProtocolClass
A ProtocolClass defines messages and is the interface specification for a Port

A ProtocolClass provides a reusable interface specification for ports. It defines a set of incoming and outgoing Messages that can be exchanged between two ports.
The exact semantics of a message is defined by the CommunicationType.
Protocol classes have only textual notation.

```room
ProtocolClass SimpleProtocolClass {
	incoming {
		Message msg1(int32}
		Message msg2()
	}
	outgoing {
		Message msg3(DataClass1}
		Message msg4()
	}

### RelayPort
A RelayPort forwards its messages without exposing them to the internal interface of the ActorClass

```room
ActorClass RelayPortExample{
	Interface {
		Port relayPort : PSimpleProtocol
	}
	Structure {
		ActorRef actorRef1 : SimpleActorClass2
		
		// relayPort can be directed to port of an ActorRef
		Binding relayPort and actorRef1.externalPort
	}
	Behavior {
		// relayPort not available !
	}
}
```

### Replication
Replication is mechanism for multi-instantiation for ActorRefs and Ports

ActorRefs and Ports can be instantiated several times under the same name. The notation is similar to arrays in programming languages.

This possibility provides an elegant way of scaling of your system without redundancy.

```room
ActorRef sensor : Sensor 			// one instance
ActorRef sensor[1] : Sensor			// one instance
ActorRef sensorArray[5] : Sensor	// five instances  
```

Replication can also applied to Ports. One use case is to establish a communication with multiple actors through one port interface.
```room
Port service[5] : TimingService 	// five instances
Port service[*] : TimingService		// automatic, as many as needed
```

### SAP
A Service Access Point is similar to a Port, but uses a LayerConnection for wiring


- An actor class can define a Service Provision Point (SPP) to publish a specific service, defined by a protocol class
- An actor class can define a Service Access Point (SAP) if it needs a service, defined by a protocol class
- For a given actor hierarchy, a LayerConnection defines which SAP will be satisfied by (connected to) which SPP

### StateMachine
A StateMachine describes the state based, event driven behavior of an ActorClass

In ROOM each actor class can implement its behavior using a state machine. Events occurring at the end ports of an actor will be forwarded to and processed by the state machine. Events possibly trigger state transitions.

### SubSystemClass
A SubSystem is the topmost building block of the executable part of an system

It represents a class for an logical node in a distributed system. An instantiation translates to an executable application, that runs on a node or process.
A SubSystemClass is the structural starting point of an ROOM application. Thus it declares the topmost actor instances (ActorRefs).

### SubSystemRef
A Sub System Reference is an instance of an SubSystemClass

It represent a logical node in the structural view of a distributed system. An instantiation translates to an executable application, that runs on a node or process.
	
To be executable, a SubSystemRef has first to be mapped to a physical node, which defines the executional properties.
A physical node is denoted by a NodeClass and NodeRef in the PhysicalModel. The mapping is defined in the MappingModel.

## MappingModel
The MappingModel describes the mapping of elements of the LogicalModel to elements of the PhysicalModel

It enables the complete decoupling of the LogicalModel and the PhysicalModel, thus providing a maximum flexibility and reuse for the models.

The model starts with an import part, where you can import .room and .etphys models. They must contain at least one LogicalSystem and one PhysicalSystem.
A Mapping entry puts both in relation, meaning that all sub systems of the LogicalSystem will be distributed to the nodes of the PhysicalSystem.
This is carried out by a SubSystemMapping, that maps a SubSystemRef (logical node) to a NodeRef (physical node).
In the next step, ThreadMappings provide the same action for the logical and physical threads.

```etmap
MappingModel PingPongMapping {
	import PingPong_Model.* from "PingPong.room"
	import GenericPhysicalModel.* from "GenericPhysical.etphys"

	Mapping LogSys -> PhysSys1 {
		SubSystemMapping subSystemRef -> nodeRef1 {
			ThreadMapping defaultThread -> PhysicalThread1
		}
	}

}
```

</tr>
</tbody>

---


## PhysicalModel
The PhysicalModel defines the setup of your nodes with their attributes like threads and mode of execution

The model describes the physical view of your system:

```etphys
PhysicalSystem PhysSys1 {
	NodeRef nodeRef1 : NodeClass1
	NodeRef nodeRef2 : NodeClass2
}
```

The central element is a NodeClass, that models the executional aspects of a device (node).
At first, it can be associated with a RuntimeClass, which specifies if your device supports multiple threads.
'priomin' and 'priomax' define the range of priorities, that can be assigned to threads.

```etphys
NodeClass NodeClass1 {
	runtime = RuntimeClass1
	priomin = -10
	priomax = 10

	// Thread definitions ...
}

RuntimeClass RuntimeClass1 {
	model = multiThreaded // or singleThreaded
}
```

A thread has to specify the following properties:

- **execmode**: defines the execution type, see more at ExecutionType
	- blocked: message-driven only, thread wakes up if message arrives and is put to sleep after all action is done
	- polled: data-driven only, thread is executed cyclic. The 'interval' property is mandatory in this case.
	- mixed: combines both execution types

- **msgblocksize**: the size in bytes of a message
- **msgpoolsize**:  the amount of messages, that the thread's message queue can store

Note: 'msgblocksize' and 'msgpoolsize' also apply to the polled execution due the internal implementation via message passing.
 The size of the message queue can be calculated as follows: msgpoolsize * msgblocksize bytes 

```etphys
DefaultThread ThreadMessaging {
	execmode = polled
	prio = 0
	stacksize = 1024
	msgblocksize = 32
	msgpoolsize = 10
}

Thread ThreadPolled {
	execmode = polled
	prio = 0
	interval = 100ms
	stacksize = 1024
	msgblocksize = 32
	msgpoolsize = 10
}
```

### DataLogging
Runtime logger for data-driven Messages with primitive data.

The DataLogging uses an annotation to configure the generated instrumentation:

```room
@DataLogging(pathlist = "/portInstancePath,/portInstancePath,..")
```

Where `pathlist` is a string specifying a list of port instances which should be instrumented for data logging:

- the path of a port instance starts with the name of the [LogicalSystem][] and thus consists of at least 4 following segments
`/portInstancePath` = `/LogicalSystem/SubSystemRef/ActorRef/Port`
- multiple paths are separated through comma (`,`), but avoid any whitespace
- the [Port][] must be conjugated and it´s [ProtocolClass][] has to be data-driven
- only the first Message having primitive or enum typed data is considered

The logging status can be verified in the generation console. It will output an overview of all accepted ports. In the [GenerationOptions][] is possible to (de)activate the data logging and thus ignoring the presence of the annotation.

At runtime the data values will then be logged

- into a file *log/SubSystemRef.data.csv*
- it contains one column for each port instance
- and a new row for every polling cycle, containing all readout data values
- the first column is used to number the cycles

Multi-Threading is not supported, the system must have not more than one polled/async physical thread.


The built-in **Gnuplot script generator** provides a convenient way to visualize the logged data. It generates a gnuplot script that can be used to create graphs from the logged data values.

* Download Gnuplot from [www.gnuplot.info](http://www.gnuplot.info/) and add it to the environment variable *PATH* (e.g. `C:\Program Files\gnuplot\bin;`)
* Use the `@Gnuplot` and `@GnuplotGraph` to configure the script generation (see example)
* The generated artifacts can be found in *src-gen/gnuplot*:
	- *xxx.csv-script.plt* - the gnuplot script, the resulting images are place in folder *log/*
	- *create_gnuplot.launch* - a launch configuration to call gnuplot executable with above script
