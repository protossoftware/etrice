<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >This example project <span 
class="ec-lmtt-10">org.eclipse.etrice.examples.c </span>illustrates a simplified traffic light control. It actually
consists of four different steps of increasing complexity that can be generated and built one by one (but not in
parallel).
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >Most of the classes are contained in a common ROOM model <span 
class="ec-lmtt-10">model/TrafficLight/TrafficLight.room </span>that also shows
how ROOM classes can form a library and used as building blocks for several systems. Also the physical model is shared by all
steps of this example.
</p><!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >Contained in the example you will find a little Java GUI that some of the example use to simulate a real traffic light. The GUI
is contacted using TCP/IP ports 4441 and subsequent. The protocol used on the TCP/IP socket connection is a simple text
protocol with commands for the lights. Three of the example steps make use of this simulator GUI. They also contain a
launch configuration for it.
</p><!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ec-lmssbx-10">Note: </span>Before compiling and linking a new step of the example the project should be cleaned to avoid duplicate symbols due
to artifacts from the previous build.

<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" >A <span 
class="ec-lmtt-10">PedestrianTrafficLightController </span>is an actor that controls a traffic light consisting of a traffic light with
red, yellow and green for the cars, a second traffic light with just red and green and a request button for the
pedestrians.
</p><!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >The controller has two ports, <span

the high level commands <span 
class="ec-lmtt-10">standby</span>, <span 
class="ec-lmtt-10">start </span>and <span 
class="ec-lmtt-10">stop</span>. The second one uses a conjugated protocol <span

which controls each of the lights separately.
</p><!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >The test harness <span
